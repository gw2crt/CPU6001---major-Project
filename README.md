Project Description:

A keen interest of data logging and acquisition within motorcycle racing has led to the proposal of this project to be developed in conjunction with Retail Sensing LTD. The Manchester based company manufacture and supply retail intelligence and customer counting equipment to larger organisations and industries.   
The proposed project is based upon the development of a prototype device used to acquire vehicle movement data by the use of a Raspberry Pi single-board miniature computer connected with a 3-axis accelerometer. Acquired data is to be transmitted to a central Mongo database using the MQTT messaging protocol allowing system integration upon project completion.  
The development of this system will allow Retail Sensing LTD to produce in depth analytical reports on commercial vehicle movements through the analysis of acquired data provided by the prototype. 

Aims and Objectives

Project Aims:
Develop a system providing a mechanism to acquire, transit and store vehicle movement data to a central database.
Produce prototype software to read and analyse data held within the database 

Objectives:



Nature of Academic Challenge:

This project demands the development of several key functional skills in areas which are beneficial to prospective employers thus improving the individual’s employability within the computing industry. Such skills include project planning, project management, time management, communication, problem solving and analytical skills. 
Research and understanding of modern technologies, such as MQTT and I2C, together with the further development of programming languages including JavaScript and Linux based commands will be met throughout this project lifecycle. 
Challenges surrounding the creation, development and operability of a Mongo database together with the use and understanding of Node.js will need to be overcome to complete the project together with the company’s needs and requirements.
